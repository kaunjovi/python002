You probably use it dozens of times a day without even knowing it. Each time you do a web search on Google or Bing, that works so well because their machine learning software has figured out how to rank what pages. When Facebook or Apple's photo application recognizes your friends in your pictures, that's also machine learning. Each time you read your email and a spam filter saves you from having to wade through tons of spam, again, that's because your computer has learned to distinguish spam from non-spam email. So, that's machine learning. There's a science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. One of the research projects that I'm working on is getting robots to tidy up the house. How do you go about doing that? Well what you can do is have the robot watch you demonstrate the task and learn from that. The robot can then watch what objects you pick up and where to put them and try to do the same thing even when you aren't there. For me, one of the reasons I'm excited about this is the AI, or artificial intelligence problem. Building truly intelligent machines, we can do just about anything that you or I can do. Many scientists think the best way to make progress on this is through learning algorithms called neural networks, which mimic how the human brain works, and I'll teach you about that, too. In this class, you learn about machine learning and get to implement them yourself.

If you are a programmer I would suggest scikit learn in python.R too is good. \nThen to get your hands dirty you can download dataset from Uci ML repository.try the iris classification problem.scikit learn already has the dataset.another problem you can try is to identify hand written digits using the MNIST dataset.\n\n\nTom Mitchell's Machine Learning - understanding concepts. \nwhich I think is a great read for understanding the concepts, not as much for code examples though) have used the dataset for the \"Play Tennis\" example as an introduction to Machine Learning. \n\nWhat the fk is that? \nhttps://www.quora.com/Whats-the-Hello-World-program-of-machine-learning\nhttps://in.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009/\n\n\n# Fan-tastick rickshaw \n\nAuto rickshaws or autos \n\n[click here](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy)\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport_in_Mumbai\n\n\n\n\n# Use google play in your application. \n\n- Install google play services. 24\n- [What is this thing for?](http://stacktips.com/how-to/installing-google-play-services-in-genymotion-emulator)\n\n# Get location from google play on android application. \n\n- [Google link](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud876-5/lessons/3987338872/concepts/43346201990923)\n\n### edit build.gradle\n\n```\ncompile com....play-services:7+ \n```\n\n### edit manifest file. \n\n```\nmeta data android name com....gms.version \nuser permission   access fine location \n```\n\n### sequence of code \n\n- oncreate create google api client \n- onstart use google api client to connect to location service \n- if failed then on connection failed then start again \n- if suspended then on connection suspended then probably cache some information \n- if on connected create location request \n- on location changed get location. \n- [link for the flow](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud876-5/lessons/3987338872/concepts/43251598620923)\n\n### Create a SHA debug key. \n\n```\n$ cd ~/.android\n\n$ pwd \n/Users/parthabhattacharjee/.android\n\n$ keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android\nAlias name: androiddebugkey\nCreation date: Aug 15, 2015\nEntry type: PrivateKeyEntry\nCertificate chain length: 1\nCertificate[1]:\nOwner: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US\nIssuer: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US\nSerial number: 7afc6549\nValid from: Sat Aug 15 20:29:25 IST 2015 until: Mon Aug 07 20:29:25 IST 2045\nCertificate fingerprints:\n   MD5:  95:AD:DC:9F:2F:5A:61:08:C2:67:8B:1A:77:58:CF:7D\n   SHA1: 3D:3F:32:4C:52:4A:10:BC:E0:AC:71:D6:7B:0C:6F:EE:3B:A5:81:1B\n   SHA256: 49:87:D5:AC:23:71:6B:18:AD:01:6D:7C:9D:B1:81:F5:02:05:79:77:80:50:0A:A4:2E:74:4F:B7:4D:A8:03:2E\n   Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA\n   Version: 3\n\nExtensions: \n\n#1: ObjectId: 2.5.29.14 Criticality=false\nSubjectKeyIdentifier [\nKeyIdentifier [\n0000: D6 FE A9 5F 4F BF 5F 8F   23 22 3A 7F A4 9A EA FA  ..._O._.#\":.....\n0010: 97 31 8F 2C                                        .1.,\n]\n]\n\n```\n\nlogin to https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects\ncreate project \napi and auth | apis | google plus api \n{\"installed\":{\"client_id\":\"211205559617-jtfo5qbqsub063eqddb782vkhbubjad5.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\"project_id\":\"hybrid-dominion-165017\",\"auth_uri\":\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\"token_uri\":\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\":\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\"redirect_uris\":[\"urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob\",\"http://localhost\"]}}\n\n\n\nv_saroha@hotmail.com\n\n# Tips for online presence. \n\nHighlight. \nOnline courses. \n\n\n# Where to learn android programming? \n\n- [Android courses by Google.](https://www.udacity.com/india)\n- [Dont create your user login.

E. Shaw & Co. - Cadabra to Amazon \nAs of early 2017, Amazon had nearly 269,000 employees worldwide\n\nNon-clustered and clustered index\n\n\n# Amazon leadership principles\n\nCustomer Obsession\nLeaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.\n\nOwnership\nLeaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job\". \n\nInvent and Simplify\nLeaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here\". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.\n\nAre Right, A Lot\nLeaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.\n\nLearn and Be Curious\nLeaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.\n\nHire and Develop the Best\nLeaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.\n\nInsist on the Highest Standards\nLeaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.\n\nThink Big\nThinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.\n\nBias for Action\nSpeed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. \n\n## Frugality\n  - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.\n  - do more with less \n  - -----------------\n  - save ops headcount. \n  - kill the tail. \n  - in case an application does not fit into the rest of the portfolio, give them away. \n\n## Earn Trust\n  - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.\n  - At the end of the day, the team is the source of strength. \n  - It is important to know each member of the team accurately, know their strengths and weak spots. \n  - It is only possible when the leader connects with the team. This can only happen when the team is treated with humility, respectfully and with honesty. \n  - Communication plan\n  - ------------------\n  - Each product team meets once a month for all hands on where the report card is presented in details. \n  - With all leads and designated high performers there is a monthly one to one. documented next steps. \n  - With all teams there is a skip level meeting, at regular intervals. \n  - There is a monthly report card that is published by each team. \n\n## Dive Deep\n  - Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote   differ. No task is beneath them.\n  - Urgent\n  - ------ \n  - P1. Standing instruction to text for every case. In case of escalations, get in call as the AD lead. \n  - P1. All cases. Friday. Weekly call with all leads. \n  - P1. All cases. Monday morning call to provide sr. mgmt. \n  - Non urgent, Important \n  - ---------------------\n  - Randomly join weekly / daily scrum meetings, to be in touch with the grassroot detals. \n  - Working towards sending critical stability, management metrics from prod over emails to AD, ProdSupport. \n  - Insists on access to codebase. Randomly pull code and review. \n  - Dev fridays. Critical dev, arch updates are shared. \n      \n\n## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n  - Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\n  - Graphs are not required for the MVP in MyReports. \n    + Challanged on the basis of SME knowledge and understanding. Disagreed. \n    + Spawn off another thread to collect data about usage of graphs. In progress. \n    + Did a demo to sr. stakeholders from client. Most of the feedback was on the ease of creating new reports and formatting them. \n    + We agreed on a list of features for MVP. Clients chose not to put graphs on that. \n  - ??  \n\n\n## Deliver Results\nLeaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision with less data \n  vocally self critical \n  backbone - feature which is good for \n  technologies - 5  / 6 \n\nThink big - vision \n\nTeam - self motivated - 100 members\n\nLeadership principles \n\n2 project detailed description - data, users, \n\nproblem solving - \n  - telephonic machines - \n  - vending machine \n  - smallest path \n  - IPL dashboard \n  - one liner \n    + clear assumptions \n    + probe \n    + dealing with ambiguity \n    + user base / scale / 10X user base \n    + frugality \n\nAWS \n  - familiarity with cloud \n\n\n\n\n\n# [Spring Boot and AngularJS](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/spring/boot/spring-boot-and-angularjs-integration-tutorial/)\n\n\n# When should we use bower and when npm? \n  - It seems we can download js using bower.
